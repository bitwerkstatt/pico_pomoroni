# pico_pomoroni
Adaptation of several examples for the Pimoroni Unicorn Pico in one file.

# Usage

- Button X starts a pomodoro timer with the usual 25/5 timing.
- Button A starts a simulation of a super computer blinking display like seen in many 80's movies.
- Button B starts a berlin clock simulation
- Button Y stops the running routine and clears the screen.

# Berlin clock

Once the clock is running you can use BUTTON_X to change into settings mode.
BUTTON_A adjusts the hours, BUTTON_B adjusts the minutes. Pressing BUTTON_X again saves the time to the RTC.
